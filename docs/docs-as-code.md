## Abstract

Documentation as Code (*Docs as Code*) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code:

- Issue Trackers
- Version Control (Git)
- Plain Text Markup (Markdown, [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), Asciidoc)
- Code Reviews
- Automated Tests

This means following the same workflows as development teams, and being integrated in the product team.

It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation,
and work together to make it as good as possible.

Generally a *Docs as Code* approach gives you the following benefits:

- Writers integrate better with development teams
- Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
- You can block merging of new features if they don't include documentation, which encourages developers to write about features while they are fresh
